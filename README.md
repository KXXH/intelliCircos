# IntelliCircos

![logo](./public/logo.jpeg)

**IntelliCircos** is a data-driven and AI-powered authoring tool for Circos plots, designed to support the creation, editing, and exploration of complex circular visualizations. By integrating language models with vector-based semantic retrieval, the system provides intelligent assistance for visual design and semantic editing, particularly suited for fields such as genomics, bioinformatics, and complex network analysis.

This project is described in detail in our EuroVis 2025 publication:

> 📦 Circos dataset (annotated cases and examples) is hosted in a separate repository: [IntelliCircos-Dataset](https://github.com/KXXH/IntelliCircos-Dataset)

# Getting Started

## Frontend

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173.

## Backend
Before running the backend, please download the required language model weights from:

👉 [https://huggingface.co/hfl/chinese-llama-2-13b](https://huggingface.co/hfl/chinese-llama-2-13b)

Place the downloaded files in project root directory.

Then start the backend service:
```
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

# Docker Support

Docker-based deployment is currently under development. A Dockerfile and setup instructions will be provided in future releases.

# Dataset Access
The dataset used for system demonstration and evaluation is hosted in a separate repository: [IntelliCircos-Dataset](https://github.com/KXXH/IntelliCircos-Dataset).

Due to institutional intellectual property constraints, the complete dataset cannot be made fully public at this time. A limited number of representative Circos plot cases are provided for demonstration and reproducibility.
